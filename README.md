# tic-tac-toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, two-player game that, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.

Tic-tac-toe is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media.

--Gameplay--
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid.
To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3-by-3.
In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
One of the game's best strategies involves creating a "fork," which is placing your mark in such a way that you have the opportunity to win two ways on your next turn. Your opponent can only block one, thereby, you can win after that.
